# PHAS0060IMF
This is a repository of my code used in my PHAS0060 Research Project: `How do galaxies form their stars?'.

Description of files:
- imf_output.txt: Text file of parameters used in graph plotting. Some parameters have been obtained from the ZFIRE dataset or ZFOURGE catalogue.
- output_code.py: Python code to calculate the EW, colour, SFR and other parameters outputted in imf_output.txt. The details to obtaining the parameters can be found in my thesis
- graphplotting_code. py: Python code to plot the graphs of H$\alpha$ EW against colour and other plots required in the thesis
